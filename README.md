# Research Lab Portfolio

A high-performance, interactive portfolio showcasing experiments in **Edge AI**, **3D Visualization**, and **Distributed Systems**. This project serves as a digital garden for my research in efficient vision transformers (FaViT), client-side inference, and scalable web graphics.

## 🧪 Experiments & Modules

### 01. Edge Inference Lab
A fully client-side inference engine powered by **ONNX Runtime Web**.
- **Real-time Performance**: Benchmarking small-scale models (like MobileNet) directly in the browser.
- **Privacy-First**: No data leaves the user's device.

### 02. Interactive Training Pipeline
A visual simulation of a distributed ML training workflow using **React Flow**.
- **Visual Nodes**: Represents data augmentation, TPU cluster allocation, and model export steps.
- **Interactive**: Inspect configuration snippets for each stage of the pipeline.

### 03. Interactive 3D Knowledge Graph
A force-directed 3D graph visualizing the connection between skills, research domains, and project concepts.
- **Tech**: Built with `react-force-graph-3d` and Three.js.
- **Data**: Visualizing relationships between FaViT, ProbSparse Attention, and core ML/Web concepts.

### 04. Engineering Log
A terminal-styled changelog tracking the journey of optimizing models and refactoring code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Three.js, React Force Graph, React Flow
- **AI/ML**: ONNX Runtime Web
- **Language**: TypeScript

## 🚀 Getting Started
